# TODO

This project was created to teach students how to use React with TypeScript. To create the project, we used the “Vite” project development and build server. During my studies I taught:
+ download custom fonts,
+ naming classes according to the BEM methodology,
+ creating an animation component,
+ use Context to change the application language,
+ use of LocalStorage to save information.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
